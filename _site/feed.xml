However, it has also been known for its crime rates. The San Francisco Police Department keeps detailed records of all reported crimes, including the type of crime, the date and time it occurred, and its location. The San Francisco crime dataset contains information about incidents reported to the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) from 2003 to 2018. The dataset is publicly available and is updated on a daily basis. It includes detailed information about the time, location, category, and description of each incident. The dataset contains over 1.5 million incidents and is used by law enforcement agencies, researchers, journalists, and concerned citizens to analyze crime trends and inform decision-making.

The dataset contains over 1.5 million incidents and is used by law enforcement agencies, researchers, journalists, and concerned citizens to analyze crime trends and inform decision-making. This is a time-series plot shows the number of crimes in each category over the years in San Francisco. The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the number of crimes in each category. Each category is represented by a different line color, and the legend is displayed on the plot to indicate which color represents which category. We can see that the most frequent crime categories over the decade are Larceny/Theft and Non/Criminal. Other crimes such as Assault, Vehicle Theft and Burglary are also frequent but have lower counts compared to Larceny/Theft and Non/Criminal. Interestingly, we can also see that some crime categories experienced a significant decrease over time, such as Prostitution, while other categories had an increase in crime over time, such as Drug/Narcotic. Overall, this Graph gives a clear overview of how the different crime categories have changed over the years in San Francisco. We can see from the plot that most crime categories have shown a decreasing trend over the past decade, with a few exceptions. We can also see that some categories, such as &amp;quot;Burglary&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Motor Vehicle Theft&amp;quot;, show a seasonal trend, with higher rates. The plot also allows us to compare the trends of different categories, and we can see that some categories, such as &amp;quot;Larceny/Theft&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Vandalism&amp;quot;, show similar trends over the years.

            San Francisco is known for its picturesque location, culture, and
            diverse communities. However, it has also been known for its crime
            rates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
            The San Francisco Police Department keeps detailed records of all
            reported crimes, including the type of crime, the date and time it
            occurred, and its location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
            The San Francisco crime dataset contains information about incidents
            reported to the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) from 2003 to
            2018. The dataset is publicly available and is updated on a daily
            basis. It includes detailed information about the time, location,
            category, and description of each incident. The dataset contains
            over 1.5 million incidents and is used by law enforcement agencies,
            researchers, journalists, and concerned citizens to analyze crime
            trends and inform decision-making.

            This is a time-series plot shows the number of crimes in each
            category over the years in San Francisco. The x-axis represents the
            years, and the y-axis represents the number of crimes in each
            category. Each category is represented by a different line color,
            and the legend is displayed on the plot to indicate which color
            represents which category. We can see that the most frequent crime
            categories over the decade are Larceny/Theft and Non/Criminal. Other
            crimes such as Assault, Vehicle Theft and Burglary are also frequent
            but have lower counts compared to Larceny/Theft and Non/Criminal.
            Interestingly, we can also see that some crime categories
            experienced a significant decrease over time, such as Prostitution,
            while other categories had an increase in crime over time, such as
            Drug/Narcotic. Overall, this Graph gives a clear overview of how the
            different crime categories have changed over the years in San
            Francisco.

            We can see from the plot that most crime categories have shown a
            decreasing trend over the past decade, with a few exceptions. &lt;br /&gt;
            We can also see that some categories, such as &quot;Burglary&quot; and &quot;Motor
            Vehicle Theft&quot;, show a seasonal trend, with higher rates. The plot
            also allows us to compare the trends of different categories, and we
            can see that some categories, such as &quot;Larceny/Theft&quot; and
            &quot;Vandalism&quot;, show similar trends over the years.
