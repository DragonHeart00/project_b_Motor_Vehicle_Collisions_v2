            This is a time-series plot shows the number of crimes in test
            category over the years in San Francisco. The x-axis represents the
            years, and the y-axis represents the number of crimes in each
            category. Each category is represented by a different line color,
            and the legend is displayed on the plot to indicate which color
            represents which category. We can see that the most frequent crime
            categories over the decade are Larceny/Theft and Non/Criminal. Other
            crimes such as Assault, Vehicle Theft and Burglary are also frequent
            but have lower counts compared to Larceny/Theft and Non/Criminal.
            Interestingly, we can also see that some crime categories
            experienced a significant decrease over time, such as Prostitution,
            while other categories had an increase in crime over time, such as
            Drug/Narcotic. Overall, this Graph gives a clear overview of how the
            different crime categories have changed over the years in San
            Francisco.

            We can see from the plot that most crime categories have shown a

            We can also see that some categories, such as "Burglary" and "Motor
            Vehicle Theft", show a seasonal trend, with higher rates. The plot
            also allows us to compare the trends of different categories, and we
            can see that some categories, such as "Larceny/Theft" and
            "Vandalism", show similar trends over the years.
