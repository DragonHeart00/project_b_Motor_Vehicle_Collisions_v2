      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
       The Motor Vehicle Collisions data contains the details of the crash event split by 5 boroughs of NYC. 
       In the event of crash, the police department records the information by filling out a police report (MV104-AN) in the cases where someone is killed, 
       injured or the damage is more than 1000$ worth.
       We have chosen a five-year window (2018-2022) to study the components, 
       capturing the most recent trends, and leaving out the data for 2023 as it is an ongoing year and therefore, we don’t have the complete data.
      </p>

        Automobile accidents pose a serious threat to public health all over the world. Accidents involving motor vehicles can be attributed to a wide range of causes, such as human error, mechanical failure, 
        poor infrastructure, and natural disasters. In 2016, road traffic injuries were responsible for an estimated 1.35 million deaths globally, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In other words, on average, one person is killed every 26 seconds.
        Accident data analysis provides valuable information to law enforcement organizations, allowing them to better allocate resources 
        and create more effective traffic enforcement and education initiatives. Additionally, insurance firms can more accurately 
        price policies for motorists by studying data on auto accidents.

       Injuries, fatalities, and economic losses due to road traffic accidents continue to be a global public health problem despite efforts to reduce them. New obstacles occur as advances in transportation infrastructure, vehicle engineering, and population dynamics provide fresh challenges.
       Vehicle accidents can be caused by a wide variety of variables, and in order to reduce their occurrence, it is essential to analyze these incidents.
       By combining data visualization with basic statistical analysis, our team will create a foundational model that can shed light on the problem, guide efforts to reduce the number of accidents, and even be used to help prepare machine learning algorithms.
       Using an Exploratory Data Analysis, we are trying to identify the key factors, timings, locations, vehicle types influencing the collisions and crashes.

        San Francisco is known for its picturesque location, culture, and
        diverse communities. However, it has also been known for its crime
        rates.  The San Francisco Police Department keeps detailed records of all
        reported crimes, including the type of crime, the date and time it
        occurred, and its location. The San Francisco crime dataset
        contains information about incidents reported to the San Francisco
        Police Department (SFPD) from 2003 to 2018. The dataset is
        publicly available and is updated on a daily basis. It includes detailed
        information about the time, location,category, and description of
        each incident. The dataset contains over 1.5 million incidents and is
        used by law enforcement agencies, researchers,
        journalists, and concerned citizens to analyze crime trends and inform
        decision-making.
